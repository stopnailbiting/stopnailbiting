title: Ultimate Treatment for Nail Biting
excerpt_separator:  <!--more-->
---

I have been biting and picking my finger nails and skins for more than 20 years. I finally stopped now.

I want to share with you the treatment I have used - you don't need to see a doctor, the treatment costs nothing, and it should work no matter how severe your symptons are.

### Failed attempts

Below is a list of approaches I have tried in my long history of fighting nail biting. I still recommend you try some of them as it may be effective for you.

* [ highly recommend ] Always wear a glove if you don't find it uncomfortable. There are touchscreen gloves so you can still use your phone. 

* Use medical bandages to wrap nail and skin around nail if you don't find it uncomfortable.

* Use nail biting gel. This works effectively if you only bite your nails, but won't work if you bite your skin, or you pick your nails or skin.

* Play fidget spinner / pens / coins / cards to keep your hand busy. A great side effect is you may become a good magician.

* Make bets with your friend. Ask them to give you money if you successfully grow your nails within certain period. This is how I lose thousands of dollars to my girlfriend in multiple bets.

### Why it is hard to stop?

Two reasons: 1) It costs you nothing to bite your nails and takes less than a second to begin the bite. 2) It can be triggered mostly by stress and boredom. 

I always believe quiting nail biting is harder than quitting smoking because it's so easy for you to get into a trigger situation (stress or boredom) in daily life, and you start to bite even without realizing it. 

### The treatment

I have actually given a hint about the treatment in previous paragraph. The ultimate treatment is about self awareness - You must first realize that you are biting your nails. 

In this example spreadsheet, from now on, you need to record your behavior every time you bite your nails. Here are the things you need to record:

* Severity: Choose from mild, medium, or big. For me, medium means after bite it hurs. Big means I see blood or I have danger of infection after I bite.

* Stop?: Most important choice! Did you stop immediately after you realize you are bitting? Mark 1 if the answer is yes. Note that if there is a small piece of nail / skin is hanging there you are allowed to finish it off, ideally using a nail clipper. Try to stop but don't force yourself too hard.

* Behavior: Mark if you did one, or more of the following: nail biting, nail picking, skin biting, skin picking. If you have more innovative way to torture your finger, add your own.

* Trigger: Mark if the behavior is triggered by anxiety or boredom. Create your own trigger if needed.

* What I am doing?: Mark a 1 on the exact thing you are doing when you bite. Definitely create new columns that fit your profession and hobbies.

* Date / Time / Location: Directly write them down.

For your first week, just try to stop when you realize that you are biting, and record them. Install Google Sheets on your phone so you can record it even you are away from your computer. If you like the write them down on a notebook, it also works. After your first week, look at the log and just try to summarize under what circumstances and on what time of day you are more likely to bite.

For your second week, continue to record every bite. You should now work on two things: 

* You must stop immediately when you realize you are biting. No excuses. There's no chemicals like nicotine that make you addicted to biting. You probably also want to argue that the process of biting is relaxing so you cannot stop. A deep breath may achieve the same effect, find your alternative method. Use a nail clipper to clean up after the bite as well so it's harder for you to start another bite.

* Work on situations you fail to realize that you are biting. For me, it's watching videos and programming. Just think about your nails more when you are doing those things to enhence self awareness. Or wear gloves when you are doing these things.

At the start of your third week, take a look at your statistics of your second week. Hopefully, you have less records because you actually bite less, not because you are getting lazier to record. If you are now able to realize every time you are biting, you don't need to record anymore.

### Regression
